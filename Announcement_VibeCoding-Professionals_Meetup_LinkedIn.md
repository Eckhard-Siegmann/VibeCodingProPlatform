## Overview
If you're building production software with serious standards—Requirements Engineering, professional tooling, clean architecture, and auditability—this is for you.

After great events on VibeCoding, we identified a gap: there's barely anything in Cologne for the professionals who demand excellence. Today, we're fixing that.

## What's Happening
A monthly meetup at STARTPLATZ Cologne dedicated to hands-on technical challenges and deep dives.

**Format:** BYOD (Bring Your Own Problem) & BYOR (Bring Your Own Repo). Share the blockers you're actually facing.

## What We're Exploring
* How does Claude Code stack up against Antigravity, Amp, and other agentic frameworks?
* Optimizing the accuracy-vs-speed tradeoff through task design and LLM selection.
* Building heterogeneous agent systems across Claude, Grok, Gemini and beyond.
* Real solutions for real production challenges.

## The Philosophy
**Pros for Pros.** If you pay €50+ or you're hitting token limits on your paid subscription, this is your space.

## Organization
* **Host:** Lorenz Gräf
* **Co-moderators:** Andreas Spannagel & Andre Machon

Ready to stop comparing frameworks and actually benchmark them together? Let's go!
